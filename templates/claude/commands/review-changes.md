# Pre-PR Review Command

You are performing a comprehensive pre-PR review of code changes before they are pushed to the remote repository.

## Objectives

Analyze all changes in the current branch compared to the main branch and provide:
1. A summary of changes
2. Code quality assessment
3. Architecture compliance check
4. Potential issues and risks
5. Recommendations for improvements

## Review Process

### Step 1: Get the Changes

Run these commands in parallel to gather information:
```bash
# Get the base branch name (usually main or master)
git remote show origin | grep "HEAD branch" | cut -d ":" -f 2 | xargs

# Get current branch name
git branch --show-current

# Get list of changed files
git diff --name-status origin/main...HEAD

# Get the full diff
git diff origin/main...HEAD

# Get commit messages for this branch
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline

# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --short
```

### Step 2: Analyze File Categories

Categorize changes by type:
- **Source Code**: New features, bug fixes, refactoring
- **Tests**: New tests, test updates, test coverage
- **Configuration**: Config file changes, dependencies
- **Documentation**: README, comments, docs
- **Build/CI**: Build scripts, workflows, pipelines

### Step 3: Code Quality Assessment

Review for:
- [ ] **Clean Architecture Compliance**: Verify layer separation (domain ’ application ’ infrastructure)
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Check for `any` types, proper type annotations
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and domain errors
- [ ] **Code Duplication**: Look for repeated code patterns
- [ ] **Naming Conventions**: Consistent naming (interfaces with `I` prefix, etc.)
- [ ] **Comments**: Adequate documentation for complex logic
- [ ] **Magic Numbers**: No hardcoded values without explanation
- [ ] **Function Size**: Functions are focused and not too long
- [ ] **Dependency Injection**: Proper DI usage in constructors

### Step 4: Testing Assessment

Check:
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Are new features/changes covered by tests?
- [ ] **Test Quality**: Do tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)?
- [ ] **Mock Quality**: Are mocks complete and realistic?
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Are edge cases tested?
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Are integration points tested?

### Step 5: Breaking Changes Detection

Identify:
- [ ] **API Changes**: Modified interfaces, function signatures
- [ ] **Database Changes**: Schema modifications, migrations needed
- [ ] **Configuration Changes**: New environment variables, config requirements
- [ ] **Dependency Changes**: Updated versions, new dependencies
- [ ] **Removed Features**: Deprecated or removed functionality

### Step 6: Documentation Check

Verify:
- [ ] **README Updates**: Does README reflect new features?
- [ ] **CHANGELOG**: Are changes documented in CHANGELOG?
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Are new APIs documented?
- [ ] **Comments**: Is complex logic explained?
- [ ] **Migration Guides**: Are breaking changes documented?

### Step 7: Security & Performance

Look for:
- [ ] **Security Issues**: Exposed secrets, injection vulnerabilities, unsafe operations
- [ ] **Performance Issues**: N+1 queries, inefficient loops, memory leaks
- [ ] **Resource Leaks**: Unclosed connections, file handles
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Proper rate limiting for APIs
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Proper validation of user inputs

## Output Format

Provide a structured review in this format:

```markdown

## Next Steps

[Provide specific action items if changes are needed]

## Important Notes

- Be thorough but constructive in your feedback
- Focus on significant issues, not nitpicks
- Provide specific file paths and line numbers when pointing out issues
- Suggest concrete improvements, not just problems
- Consider the context and purpose of the changes
- If you find critical issues (security, breaking changes), highlight them prominently
- Always run the review commands even if the diff is large

## Edge Cases

- **No changes**: If there are no changes, inform the user
- **Uncommitted changes**: Warn about uncommitted changes that won't be in the PR
- **Large diffs**: Summarize large changes, don't analyze every line
- **Merge conflicts**: Check for and report any conflicts with main branch
- **Failed commands**: If git commands fail, explain what might be wrong (not in a git repo, no remote, etc.)
