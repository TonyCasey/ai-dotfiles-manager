# Codex Session Bootstrap

1. Open `AGENTS.md` immediately and follow every instruction in the Codex Session Guide.
2. Continue loading the remaining `.dev` context files exactly as listed in that guide.
3. If any required file is missing, report it so the user can add or repair it at the start of the session.
