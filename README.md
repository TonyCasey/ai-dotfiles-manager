## An easier way to manage your AI tool rules & configs
>
> Sick of .files folder overload and having to copy and paste tour rules, workflows & commands into different dotfile folders?

```bash

    â”œâ”€â”€ .claude/
    â”œâ”€â”€ .cursor/
    â”œâ”€â”€ .kilocode/
    â”œâ”€â”€ .roo/
    â””â”€â”€ ....
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install globally (once per machine)
npm install -g ai-dotfiles-manager

# 2. Navigate to your project
cd ~/projects/your-project

# 3. Run setup
ai-dotfiles-manager setup

# 4. Select tools (or use "âœ¨ Select All")
# Creates .claude/, .cursorrules, .kilocode/, .roo/ in your project

# 5. Start coding with AI assistance!
```

## Migrating Existing Configurations

If you run `ai-dotfiles-manager setup` on a project that already has AI tool configurations (.claude/, .cursorrules, etc.), you'll be prompted with migration options:

### Migration Options

**1. Migrate to .local/ (supersede shared rules)**
- Moves your existing files to `.local/` directories
- Your custom rules will override shared rules with the same names
- Best for: Projects with custom rules you want to preserve and prioritize

**2. Migrate to .local/ (preserve alongside shared rules)**
- Moves your existing files to `.local/` directories
- Your custom rules exist alongside shared rules (no override)
- Best for: Projects with additional custom rules

**3. Replace with new setup (backup old files)**
- Creates timestamped backups of existing files
- Replaces everything with fresh templates
- Best for: Starting fresh while keeping a backup

**4. Skip - keep existing configuration as-is**
- Leaves current configuration untouched
- Setup does not proceed for that tool
- Best for: Manually managed configurations

### Migration Examples

**Claude Code (.claude/)**
```bash
# Existing files moved to:
.claude/rules/.local/your-custom-rule.md

# Backups created in:
.claude/.backup/2025-10-20/
```

**Cursor (.cursorrules)**
```bash
# Existing file moved to:
.cursorrules.local

# Backup created as:
.cursorrules.backup.2025-10-20
```

**Kilo Code (.kilocode/) and Roo Code (.roo/)**
```bash
# Existing files moved to:
.kilocode/rules/.local/your-custom-rule.md
.roo/rules/.local/your-custom-rule.md

# Backups created in:
.kilocode/.backup/2025-10-20/
.roo/.backup/2025-10-20/
```

## Why Global Installation?

Global installation is the **recommended approach** because:

1. **Install Once, Use Everywhere**: One installation serves all your projects
2. **Always Available**: The command works from any directory
3. **Easy Updates**: Update once globally instead of in every project
4. **Consistent Standards**: All projects use the same rules and conventions
5. **Lightweight**: Projects don't need to include the package in dependencies

## Installation

### Option 1: Direct from GitHub (Easiest)

```bash
npm install -g git+https://github.com/TonyCasey/ai-dotfiles-manager.git

# Or install a specific version
npm install -g git+https://github.com/tony.casey/ai-dotfiles-manager.git#v1.1.0
```

### Option 2: From npm Registry

```bash
npm install -g ai-dotfiles-manager
```

### Option 3: Shared Network Location

For teams without npm infrastructure:

```bash
# Clone to shared drive
git clone https://github.com/tony.casey/ai-dotfiles-manager.git /shared/dev-tools/ai

# Each developer installs from there
npm install -g /shared/dev-tools/ai
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
ai-dotfiles-manager --version
ai-dotfiles-manager --help
```

## How It Works

### Symlinked Base Rules (Read-Only)

All base rules are **symlinked** from your project to the global package:

```bash
# After running "ai-dotfiles-manager setup":
~/projects/my-project/.claude/rules/shared/ â†’ ~/.npm-global/lib/node_modules/ai-dotfiles-manager/templates/shared/rules
~/projects/my-project/.claude/rules/typescript/ â†’ ~/.npm-global/lib/node_modules/ai-dotfiles-manager/templates/languages/typescript/rules
```

**Why symlinks?**
- âœ… Always up-to-date with team standards
- âœ… Run `ai-dotfiles-manager update` to get latest rules instantly
- âœ… No divergence from shared standards
- âœ… Consistent across all projects

**Why read-only?**
- ðŸ”’ Prevents accidental modifications to shared templates
- ðŸ”’ Forces proper use of `.local/` for customizations
- ðŸ”’ Makes it clear what's shared vs. project-specific

### Local Customizations (Writable)

Your project-specific customizations go in `.local/` directories:

```bash
~/projects/my-project/.claude/rules/.local/
  â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                    # Instructions (auto-generated)
  â”œâ”€â”€ custom-api-standards.md      # Your custom rules
  â””â”€â”€ architecture.md              # Overrides shared/architecture.md
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Full control over project-specific rules
- âœ… Commit to version control
- âœ… Survives package updates
- âœ… Clear separation from base rules

### Windows Support

- **Directories**: Use junctions (no admin required) âœ“
- **Files**: Require admin privileges or Developer Mode
- **Automatic fallback**: Files are copied when symlinks fail
- **Sync script**: Auto-generated for keeping rules updated
- See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for details

## Developer Workspace (.dev/)

The `.dev/` folder is your **personal developer workspace** that's automatically loaded into AI context for every session.

### What's in .dev/?

**architecture.md** (auto-generated)
- Project structure overview
- Technologies and frameworks
- Architectural patterns
- Key principles
- Regenerated on setup/update

**todo.md** (your personal task list)
- Markdown checkboxes for tasks
- Simply check off `[x]` when complete
- AI sees your current priorities
- Helps AI provide contextual suggestions

**README.md** (auto-generated)
- Explains the .dev/ concept
- Usage instructions

### Auto-Loading

All `.md` files in `.dev/` are automatically loaded into AI context when you start a session with:
- Claude Code
- Cursor
- Kilo Code
- Roo Code

This gives AI assistants immediate understanding of:
- What you're working on (todo.md)
- How the project is structured (architecture.md)

### Example .dev/todo.md

```markdown
# Developer Todo List

## Current Sprint

- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Add password reset functionality
- [x] Set up database schema

## Backlog

- [ ] Add email notifications
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
```

Simply change `[ ]` to `[x]` when done - no explanations needed!

### Git

The `.dev/` folder is **personal** and typically not committed:

```gitignore
.dev/
```

However, you can commit it to share architecture notes or tasks with your team.

## Multi-Language Support

The package supports multiple programming languages with language-specific and language-agnostic rules.

### Supported Languages

- **TypeScript** (fully supported)
- **Python** (planned - Phase 2)
- **Go** (planned - Phase 3)
- **Java** (planned - future)
- **Rust** (planned - future)

### Architecture

```
templates/
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/                      # Language-agnostic rules

    â”œâ”€â”€ cursor/
    â”œâ”€â”€ kilocode/
    â””â”€â”€ roo/
```

### Language Auto-Detection

The setup wizard automatically detects your project language:

```javascript
// TypeScript: tsconfig.json or typescript in package.json
// Python: requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, setup.py
// Go: go.mod
// Rust: Cargo.toml
// Java: pom.xml, build.gradle
```

### Example: Language-Specific Patterns

**TypeScript:**
```typescript
// Interface in domain/interfaces/
export interface IProductRepository {
  getById(id: string): Promise<Product>;
}

// Implementation in infrastructure/repositories/
export class ProductRepository implements IProductRepository {
  constructor(private readonly db: IDatabase) {}
}
```

**Python (coming soon):**
```python
# Protocol in domain/interfaces/
from typing import Protocol

class ProductRepositoryProtocol(Protocol):
    def get_by_id(self, id: str) -> Product:
        ...

# Implementation in infrastructure/repositories/
class ProductRepository:
    def __init__(self, db: DatabaseProtocol):
        self._db = db
```

**Go (coming soon):**
```go
// Interface in domain/
type ProductRepository interface {
    GetByID(ctx context.Context, id string) (*Product, error)
}

// Implementation in infrastructure/
type productRepository struct {
    db Database
}
```

## Commands

### `setup` - Configure AI Tools

Set up AI assistant configuration in the current project:

```bash
ai-dotfiles-manager setup
```

Interactive prompts will ask:
- Which language? (auto-detected, or choose manually)
- Which AI tools? (Claude Code, Cursor, Kilo Code, Roo Code, or âœ¨ Select All)

Creates configuration files in your project directory.

### `update` - Update Configuration

Update existing configuration with latest templates:

```bash
ai-dotfiles-manager update
```

Refreshes symlinked base rules while preserving your `.local/` customizations.

### `review` - Code Review

Analyze codebase for Clean Architecture violations:

```bash
# Basic review
ai-dotfiles-manager review

# Detailed review (includes info-level messages)
ai-dotfiles-manager review --detailed

# JSON output (for CI/CD integration)
ai-dotfiles-manager review --json
```

**What it checks:**
- Layer Violations (domain importing infrastructure, etc.)
- Interface Conventions ('I' prefix, file naming)
- Repository Pattern (correct layers, DI)
- Service Pattern (constructor injection, layers)
- Domain Errors (extend DomainError)
- TypeScript Quality (no `any` types)

### `--version` - Show Version

```bash
ai-dotfiles-manager --version
```

### `--help` - Show Help

```bash
ai-dotfiles-manager --help
```

## Slash Commands (Claude Code)

After setup, use these commands in Claude Code:

### `/create-repo`
Creates a repository following Clean Architecture:
- Repository interface in `src/domain/interfaces/`
- Domain error class (optional)
- Repository implementation in `src/infrastructure/repositories/`
- DI registration
- Comprehensive test file

### `/create-service`
Creates an application service:
- Service interface in `src/application/interfaces/`
- Service implementation in `src/application/services/`
- DI registration
- Test file with mocked dependencies

### `/create-error`
Creates a domain error:
- Error class extending `DomainError` in `src/domain/errors/`
- Export from error index
- Usage examples

### `/create-tests`
Generates test files:
- Proper test structure
- Mock dependencies setup
- Test cases for all methods
- Error case tests

## Customization

### Adding Custom Rules

Create new files in `.local/` directories:

```bash
.claude/rules/.local/
  â”œâ”€â”€ custom-api-standards.md
  â””â”€â”€ database-conventions.md
```

### Overriding Base Rules

Create a file with the same name in `.local/`:

```bash
.claude/rules/.local/
  â””â”€â”€ architecture.md    # Overrides shared/architecture.md
```

### Instructions

See `.claude/rules/.local/README.md` (auto-generated) for detailed instructions.

## Version Control

### Recommended .gitignore

```gitignore
# Ignore symlinked base rules (read-only)
.claude/rules/shared/
.claude/rules/typescript/
.claude/commands/
.cursorrules
.kilocode/rules/shared/
.kilocode/rules/typescript/
.roo/rules/shared/
.roo/rules/typescript/

# Commit local customizations
!.claude/rules/.local/
!.cursorrules.local
!.kilocode/rules/.local/
!.roo/rules/.local/

# Ignore backups (created during migration)
.claude/.backup/
.kilocode/.backup/
.roo/.backup/
.cursorrules.backup.*

# Developer workspace (personal - usually not committed)
.dev/
```

### Why?

- Base rules are symlinks â†’ don't commit (teammates will run `ai-dotfiles-manager setup`)
- Local rules are yours â†’ commit them (project-specific customizations)
- Everyone runs setup once, gets same base rules, sees your custom rules

## Team Workflow

### Day 1: New Developer Joins

```bash
# Step 1: Install the tool globally
npm install -g git+https://github.com/tony.casey/ai-dotfiles-manager.git

# Step 2: Clone first project
git clone https://github.com/your-org/my-project.git
cd my-project

# Step 3: Set up AI assistance
ai-dotfiles-manager setup

# Step 4: Start coding!
# The AI now knows all development standards
```

### Week 2: New Project Assigned

```bash
# Clone another project
git clone https://github.com/your-org/my-other-project.git
cd my-other-project

# Set up AI (takes 10 seconds)
ai-dotfiles-manager setup

# Start coding with same standards!
```

### Month 2: Rules Updated

```bash
# Update the global tool
npm update -g ai-dotfiles-manager

# Refresh projects
cd ~/projects/my-project && ai-dotfiles-manager update
cd ~/projects/my-other-project && ai-dotfiles-manager update
```

## Quality Assurance

### Testing

The package includes a comprehensive test suite ensuring reliability and maintainability:

- **53+ Unit Tests** - Comprehensive coverage of core functionality
- **100% Coverage** - Language detection module fully tested
- **SOLID Principles** - Tests follow the same principles as production code
- **Fast Execution** - Full test suite runs in < 1 second
- **CI/CD Ready** - Proper exit codes and coverage reporting

```bash
# Run the full test suite
npm test

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Code Quality

- **Dependency Injection** - All modules accept dependencies for testability
- **Pure Functions** - Predictable behavior with no side effects
- **TypeScript AST** - Robust code analysis using TypeScript compiler API
- **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of edge cases and failures
- **Documentation** - JSDoc comments and comprehensive README

### Continuous Improvement

- Tests are required for all new features
- Code reviews ensure quality and consistency
- Regular updates with latest best practices
- Community feedback drives improvements

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found"

The global bin directory is not in PATH:

```bash
# Find npm global bin directory
npm config get prefix

# Add to PATH (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export PATH="$(npm config get prefix)/bin:$PATH"

# Reload shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Symlinks Not Working

**Windows users:**
- Directory symlinks use **junctions** (no admin required) âœ“
- File symlinks require administrator privileges or Developer Mode
- **Automatic fallback**: If symlinks fail, files are copied automatically
- **Sync script**: When copying is used, a `sync-rules.js` script is added to `.claude/scripts/`
- To enable Developer Mode: Settings â†’ Update & Security â†’ For Developers â†’ Developer Mode

**Windows fallback mode:**
```bash
# When symlinks fail, update copied rules with:
node .claude/scripts/sync-rules.js

# Or add to your package.json:
"scripts": {
  "sync-claude-rules": "node .claude/scripts/sync-rules.js"
}
```

**Mac/Linux users:**
```bash
# Check if package is installed globally
npm list -g ai-dotfiles-manager

# Check file permissions
ls -la .claude/rules/
```

### Can't Edit Base Rules

This is intentional! Base rules are read-only symlinks. To customize:
1. Create files in `.claude/rules/.local/`
2. See `.claude/rules/.local/README.md` for instructions
3. Your `.local/` files take precedence over base rules

### Rules Not Being Applied

If AI isn't following the rules:
1. Check `.claude/rules/` directory exists
2. Verify `settings.json` has correct `rulesDirectory` path
3. Try explicitly referencing a rule file in your prompt
4. Restart your AI coding assistant

### Commands Not Working (Claude Code)

If slash commands don't work:
1. Check `.claude/commands/` directory exists
2. Verify `settings.json` has correct `commandsDirectory` path
3. Restart Claude Code

## Architecture Overview

### Clean Architecture Layers

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ domain/              # Core business entities and interfaces
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ errors/          # Domain error classes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ interfaces/      # Repository interfaces, core service interfaces
â”œâ”€â”€ application/         # Business logic and use cases
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ interfaces/      # Service interfaces, use case configs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ services/        # Service implementations
â””â”€â”€ infrastructure/      # External concerns
    â”œâ”€â”€ di/              # Dependency injection container
    â”œâ”€â”€ repositories/    # Repository implementations
    â””â”€â”€ services/        # External API integrations
```

### Key Principles

1. **Dependency Inversion**: Dependencies flow inward (Infrastructure â†’ Application â†’ Domain)
2. **Repository Pattern**: All data access through repositories
3. **Dependency Injection**: Constructor injection for all dependencies
4. **Interface Segregation**: One focused interface per file
5. **Domain Errors**: Specific error classes with HTTP status codes
