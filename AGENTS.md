# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Core CLI: `bin/` (entry: `bin/setup.js`)
- Library code: `lib/` (pure, testable modules like `lib/language-detector.js`)
- Scripts: `scripts/` (maintenance/migration utilities)
- Tests: `__tests__/` (Jest; fixtures and helpers included)
- Templates: `templates/` (provider/language rules copied into projects)
- Assets/Reports: `resources/`, `coverage/` (generated by tests)

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm test` — run Jest test suite.
- `npm run test:watch` — watch mode for local development.
- `npm run test:coverage` — generate coverage (HTML in `coverage/`).
- `npm run migrate` — migrate projects to centralized `.dev/rules/` layout.
- Local CLI: `node bin/setup.js` (e.g., `node bin/setup.js --help`).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- JavaScript (Node 16.14+ or 18+), CommonJS `require/module.exports`.
- Indentation: 2 spaces; prefer small, pure functions with dependency injection for IO.
- Filenames: kebab-case for files (`language-detector.js`), directories singular where appropriate.
- Avoid side effects in `lib/`; isolate process/filesystem work to `bin/` and `scripts/`.

## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: Jest (`jest.config.js`).
- Location: tests in `__tests__/`; name tests `*.test.js`.
- Coverage thresholds (global): 70% lines/branches/functions/statements. Ensure `npm run test:coverage` passes.
- Use fixtures in `__tests__/fixtures/` and helpers in `__tests__/helpers/`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Keep commits focused and descriptive (present tense). Reference issues when relevant.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for notable user-facing changes (Keep a Changelog + SemVer).
- PRs must include: clear summary, rationale, test coverage evidence, and any migration notes.
- Screenshots/log snippets welcome for CLI UX changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Base rules are managed copies in `.dev/rules/`; avoid editing them directly. Use `.dev/rules/.local/` for overrides.
- Do not commit generated `coverage/` or local project artifacts.
- Respect user environments: never overwrite existing configs without backups (pattern used across scripts).

## Agent-Specific Notes
- If adding templates, keep `.dev/rules/` as the single source of truth; providers reference it.
- New providers/languages should mirror existing template structure and testing approach.

# Codex Session Guide

On session start, load and keep the following files in working memory:

- `.dev/architecture.md`
- `.dev/todo.md` (if present)
- `.dev/rules/shared/*.md`
- `.dev/rules/typescript/*.md` (if present)
- `.dev/rules/.local/*.md` (project-specific overrides)

- Manifest: `.dev/codex-manifest.json` (authoritative load order)
- Index: `.dev/context-index.md` (links to key context)

Rules precedence: `.local` > language > shared.

Codex working agreement (from CLI reference):
- Start tool use with a 1–2 sentence preamble.
- Use `update_plan` for multi-step tasks; keep steps short.
- Prefer `rg` for search; read files in ≤250-line chunks.
- Use `apply_patch` for edits; avoid destructive commands.
- File references: backticked paths with optional :line, no ranges.
- Final answers: concise, structured bullets; headers only when helpful.

Key expectations for this repository:
- Follow Clean Architecture and Repository Pattern from rules.
- Prefer pure functions; isolate IO to scripts/ and bin/.
- Maintain test coverage ≥ 70% (see `jest.config.js`).
- Offer fixes that update docs or scripts when behavior changes.

Assistant behavior:
- Propose changes that align with loaded rules.
- When generating files, mirror naming and folder conventions.
- Surface any conflicts between `.local` and shared rules.

Example rules (not exhaustive):
- .dev/rules/shared/clean-architecture.md
- .dev/rules/shared/code-quality-rules.md
- .dev/rules/typescript/coding-standards.md
- .dev/rules/typescript/testing.md
- .dev/rules/.local/README.md
